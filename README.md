# Hey

I'm Mathieu, you can call me math or okzmo. I don't qualify myself as a SWE (because I'm not an engineer duh) but I don't think I fall short when it comes to actually doing the work. I've mostly been learning by myself for the past 2-3 years and I've stayed in the web sphere for for 2/3 of this time. I went back and forth between the front-end and backend in different languages like Go, Rust or JS/TS with node, deno etc...

## What you doing these days?

Glad you ask! (I'm schizophreniac)

- Moving out of the web sphere when it comes to learning, I don't want to be qualified as "the guy that only knows web" so I'm looking into low level stuff but I've been really interested in networking, that's the only domain (outside of web) that caught my interest and making UI for video games too but I didn't get to that yet.
- Working on my side project **NOSYNC** (not available yet) which is basically some kind of mymind but with the UI I want and the features I want.
- Somehow get better at math because it's starting to get alarming how bad I can be sometimes.

## What are you future plans?

Glad you ask! (I need to stop that)

- Getting out of my shell and maybe try to get involved in some open source projects. Not for the "it looks good on a resume" but to see what it feels/looks like to work on a "big" project with a team. Working on my soft-skills basically.

### How can I contact you?
